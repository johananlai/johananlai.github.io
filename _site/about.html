        <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>I’m Johanan, a solutions engineer at Datadog. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UC Irvine in June 2018.</p>

<p>As an engineer, I’ve had exposure to practices in software development during my time interning at Joyent, with knowledge of the coding, testing, and development processes. At Olixus, I got more hands-on, helping lead a team design and develop a mobile application in a startup environment. During my time at Datadog, I got my feet wet with AWS and Kubernetes, coming out with a better understanding of how companies use certain technologies and why.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games with friends (sometimes writing code relating to these games!) and editing videos.</p>
