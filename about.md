# About me

I'm Johanan, a solutions engineer at Datadog. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UC Irvine in June 2018.

As an engineer, I've had exposure to practices in software development during my time interning at Joyent, with knowledge of the coding, testing, and development processes. At Olixus, I got more hands-on, helping lead a team design and develop a mobile application in a startup environment. During my time at Datadog, I got my feet wet with AWS and Kubernetes, coming out with a better understanding of how companies use certain technologies and why.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games with friends (sometimes writing code relating to these games!) and editing videos.
